In this project, I used Cadence Xcelium on EDA Playground to simulate an 8-bit AND operation in SystemVerilog. I worked on creating key components like the generator for random inputs and the driver to send those inputs to the DUT via a virtual interface. The monitor tracked signals, while the scoreboard verified the results. Using mailboxes for communication and adding delays for timing control made the simulation more effective. This hands-on experience helped me understand the simulation process better and how to ensure the design functions correctly!
